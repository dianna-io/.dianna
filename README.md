You may or may not find this to be useful inspiration. In any case, it's my backup.

## installation

Idk, like, put it under your home directory, change some things, and make some symlinks.

## basic setup

- Z shell https://zsh.sourceforge.io
- Oh My Zsh https://ohmyz.sh
- Neovim https://neovim.io

Nothing fancy going on, as you can see.
